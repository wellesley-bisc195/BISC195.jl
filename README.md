## Learning Objectives 

After completing this course, students will be able to:
- Navigate their computer and manipulate files using a command line interface.
- Design and write a program from scratch to perform statistical analyses on and plot a large numerical dataset.
- Write scripts to find, download, and process large biological sequence datasets from an online source.
- Search for a solution to a novel error or software bug and implement it in code.
- Use a version control system to keep track of changes to their code.
- Approach new programming languages, computational problems or software tools with confidence.
