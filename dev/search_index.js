Users could \"checkout\" individual files to edit them, and the central repository would lock that file to prevent conflicting changes. This makes it easy to prevent conflicts, but is also a bit impractical.By contrast, git is distributed - each user's system contains the entire revision history, and conflicts between versions are explicitly managed when two different edits to the code are brought together.

And because false && <anything> is always false, that line just evaluates to false without ever getting to the println() call.
