At the same time, many biologists are intimidated by the prospect of programming. In an era of high-throughput assays and datasets with thousands of samples containing millions of molecular sequences, a basic knowledge of computational methods is critical. Many tools for analyzing vast quantities of molecular data have only command-line interfaces, and performing statistical tests or plotting these large datasets is impossible with excel or other software with a graphical user interface.

I have done my best to keep lessons concise, with minimal diversions.  This keeps things shorter, but it means that most of the content is important.  If you skip or skim sections, you may miss important concepts  and have trouble completing assignments.\nRun the code in all \"Practice,\" \"Exercise,\" and \"Example\" blocks.  This will be described in more detail later,  but it is imperative that when their are code examples,  you run them, and try to understand the output.  Programming is more about practice than theory,  and if you are only reading, you will not learn.\nMake your own modifications to code in \"Practice\", \"Exercise\", and \"Example\" blocks.  You will learn best by doing.  See what happens when you change spelling,  leave out parts of a command,  or add additional text.  Most of the time, this will produce errors,  but professional programmers encounter errors all the time.  Learning which mistakes lead to which errors  is a critical skill in programming.  I will warn you when going off the beaten path with code  might be dangerous.\nRun all the code in the examples and exercises from Think Julia  A lot of information will be redundant between the book,  lectures, and course content,   but this is intentional.  Have I mentioned before how important practice is?\nFail early and fail often. Embrace your error messages.  If you never make a mistake, you are not learning how to program.  If you are practicing enough, trying new things,  most of the time you will fail.  This is expected, and this is a good thing.  When you do an experiment in the lab,  you rarely get an error message when things go wrong.  Error messages can be daunting at first, but they often contain useful information.
