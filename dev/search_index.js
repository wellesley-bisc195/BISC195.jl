I have done my best to keep lessons concise, with minimal diversions.  This keeps things shorter, but it means that most of the content is important.

This will be described in more detail later,  but it is imperative that when their are code examples,  you run them, and try to understand the output.  Programming is more about practice than theory,  and if you are only reading, you will not learn.\nMake your own modifications to code in \"Practice\", \"Exercise\", and \"Example\" blocks.  You will learn best by doing.  See what happens when you change spelling,  leave out parts of a command,  or add additional text.  Most of the time, this will produce errors,  but professional programmers encounter errors all the time.  Learning which mistakes lead to which errors  is a critical skill in programming.  I will warn you when going off the beaten path with code  might be dangerous.\nFail early and fail often. Embrace your error messages.  If you never make a mistake, you are not learning how to program.  If you are practicing enough, trying new things,  most of the time you will fail.  This is expected, and this is a good thing.

The following is julia code:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"function my_func(x, y)\n    for i in 1:x\n        println(i + y)\n    end\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"As you can see, this block of code is formatted differently from normal text.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Sometimes, you will see \"command prompts\" such as $ for the shell or julia> for the julia REPL (don't worry if you don't know what the shell or a REPL are right now).  In these cases, when copying the code, do not include the command prompt. I will remind you about this again when it comes up, but just as an example, the following is a shell command and its output:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"$ ls -l ~/Desktop","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"  rw-r--r--   1  ksb  staff    30 KiB  Wed Apr  8 20:12:59 2020  C0005_3F_1A_1000k_1_profile.tsv\n  rw-rw-r--   1  ksb  staff     4 GiB  Wed Mar 18 15:48:06 2020  ko_profiles.sqlite\n  rw-rw-r--   1  ksb  staff     9 MiB  Mon Mar  9 16:41:35 2020  metadata.sqlite\n  rw-r--r--   1  ksb  staff     0 B    Fri Mar 27 15:07:47 2020  test.txt","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In this example, you would type just ls -l ~/Desktop and press enter.
