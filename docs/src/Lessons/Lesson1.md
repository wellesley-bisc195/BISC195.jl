  - Windows users should also have installed Windows Terminal
- Run all code examples from Lesson 1 on their own computers

This file contains instructions for completing today's lesson.
It is written in a language called "markdown",
which allows plain text to be easily converted
into nicely formatted webpages like the one you're looking at now.
But we'll come back to this.

To complete this lesson, follow the instructions below.

!!! tip
    It is even more important than usual
    to read and follow instructions
    when it comes to computers and programming.
    We will be interacting with our computers
    using procedural language - that is,
    language that follows a strict set of procedures.
    Skipping steps or doing things out of order
    can lead to unexpected results.

## [Part 1 - First steps](@id first-steps)

Most modern computer code is just text
that tells a computer what to do.
The part that is complicated is that code tends to be:

1. Literal - the computer can only do exactly what you specifically tell it;
   it won't try to guess your meaning
   and it doesn't understand nuance.
1. Procedural - you must provide **all** of the commands
   and you must provide them **in the correct order**

[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8)
to get a sense of why this matters so much.

In this course,
we'll be primarily interacting with that computer code as plain text,
but there are a bunch of tools that people have built
to make that job a bit easier.

### [Installing your IDE](@id install-ide)

One of those tools is an "Integrated Development Environment" or "IDE".
This is basically just a text editor with a bunch of bells and whistles.

There are a number of different text editors to chose from,
but in this course, we're going to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

1. [Click here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
    and select the correct download for your operating system

    ![vscode-download](../assets/img/vs-code-download.png)

1. Open the downloaded file and follow the prompts to install the program

!!! tip
    If you prefer to use a different text editor, that's ok,
    but it's important to be sure it's a _plain text_ editor
    and not a _rich text_ editor like MS Word. 
    The files saved by rich text editors contain extraneous information,
    and are not suitable for programming.

    Check with Kevin about your choice if you're unsure.

### [Installing julia](@id install_julia)

In this course,
we're primarily going to be programming in the [julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
Julia is a modern programming language
designed for scientific computing.

1. Go to the [julia downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
    and select the correct download for your operating system.

    ![julia-download](../assets/img/julia-releases.png)

1. Open the downloaded file and follow the prompts to install it.
    1. Mac users, once the `.dmg` file is opened,
       you will need to drag the app file into your `Applications` folder
    1. Windows users - there will be a `.exe` file - open it to start the installation.
1. Once the julia application is installed, open it.
   This should cause a text window to open looking something like this:

```
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.4.0 (2020-03-21)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |

julia>
```

Type `2+2` and hit `enter`, you should see the number `4`, and then another julia prompt:

```
julia> 2+2
4

julia>
```

You can close the window in the normal way, or type `exit()` and hit enter.

### [Sign up for github classroom](@id github_signup)

All assignments will be distributed,
turned in and graded through [github classroom](http://classroom.github.com/).

To use it, you need to sign up for a github account
if you don't have one already.

!!! practice "To Do"
    If you don't have an account already, get one at https://github.com/join.

    !!! warning "Privacy Note"
        You do not need to use your wellesley.edu email address to create this account, but let Kevin know if you use a different address so that you get credit for your work.

    If you'd like, you may sign up for a [github student discount pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
    This is not necessary for this course.

## Part 2 - Navigating the filesystem using the terminal

You are probably already familiar with
your computer's "filesystem"[^1].
If you've ever looked at files on your `Desktop`,
or opened `Finder`/`Explorer` and navigated to your `Documents` folder,
you've been using the file system.
Data is stored on your hard drive as a continuous binary sequence (just `1`s and `0`s)
and without a filesystem, it would be impossible to find anything!

`Finder`/`Explorer` are software programs used to interact with your filesystem.
The filesystem contains a mix of files,
which are blobs of information (eg. a `.docx` file containing a MS Word doc)
and folders, which can contain files as well as other folders.
Just to be confusing,
what we colloquially call folders are technically called "directories."
I will use the terms interchangeably.

![File system hierarchy](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/macintosh-terminal-pocket/9781449328962/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1448104.png)

You may not have thought much about how the filesystem is organized,
but you probably have an intuitive sense of how this works.
Your "home"[^3] directory contains the `Desktop` and `Documents` directories,
each of which might contain many other subdirectories and/or files,
and each subdirectory may have yet more subdirectories and files and so on.

`Finder`/`Explorer` are examples of a graphical user interface (GUI - pronounced "gooey"),
that is a program that allows you to interact with it visually.
However, GUIs are difficult to design and maintain,
so most bioinformatics tools are built around "command line"[^4]
or text-based interfaces.
The good news is that the organization of the filesystem
is the same whether you're interacting with it in a GUI or in the terminal.
And once you learn how to use the command line interface,
you'll see that it is a powerful way to get a lot done quickly.

### Open the terminal application

**Mac Users**:  
1. Open Applications
2. Click Open the `Terminal` application

**Windows Users**:  
1. Click Start -> Programs
2. Open Windows Subsystem for Linux

You will be greeted with a white or black box that contains some text,
and a cursor next to the dollar symbol `$`.
This is the command prompt.

!!! tip
    Using the terminal can be quite challenging at first.
    For one, you cannot interact with text
    in the same way as you would in a word-processing program
    like Microsoft Word.
    In particular,
    you can't use your mouse to do things like click to move a cursor,
    or highlight a section of text to be deleted.
    Instead, you have to use `←` and `→` keys.

### Walk around your file system

Think of your filesystem as a branching network of roads
that you can walk along.
Each directory is a location that has a path back to its parent directory,
may or may not contain objects (files),
and may have one or many roads leading to new locations (subdirectories).

Your present location,
referred to as the "working directory"[^5],
is your home folder when you first open the terminal.
Let's see where that is.

In your terminal, type `pwd` and press enter.
This is the "print working directory" command.

```sh
$ pwd
```
```
/home/kevin
```

If you're using a Mac,
this probably displayed something like `/Users/yourname`.

!!! tip
    Whenever you see code blocks in these lessons that start with `$ `,
    this is a hint that it is a shell command.
    When copying or typing these commands,
    **do not** include the `$ ` (or anything to the left of it).
    For example, to complete the task above,
    you should only type `pwd`,
    then press enter.

    `$` is referred to as the "prompt" or "command prompt."
    When you enter a command, you may or may not see some output
    (which will not be preceded by `$`)
    and once the command has finished executing,
    you will see a new prompt.

    **NOTE:** These code blocks will often be followed by a block
    that does **not** start with a `$`.
    This is the expected output;
    you shouldn't try to copy-past this into your terminal.

Let's take a look around.
the `ls` command is used to `l`i`s`t
the contents of the directory.

```sh
$ ls
```
```
bin      Documents     R       scratch
Desktop  Downloads     Public  repos
```

Your output will likely look a bit different from mine,
but you'll probably see `Documents` and `Desktop`,
as well as other directories you may recognize.

!!! compat "Windows Users"
    You may not see any output.
    This is because the default Ubuntu installation on Windows
    doesn't have any directories or files in the home folder.
    But we can actually trick the shell
    into using the Windows home folder instead.
    In the following command,
    replace `<yourname>` with your Windows username.

    ```sh
    $ export HOME=/mnt/c/Users/<yourname>
    $ cd ~
    $ pwd
    /mnt/c/Users/<yourname>
    ```

    Now, enter `ls` again,
    and you should see the contents of your Windows home folder.


The `ls` command can also take a directory
as an "argument."[^8]
We'll talk more about what that means later -
for now, just add `Desktop` to the command, separated by a space

```sh
$ ls Desktop
```
```
df.csv  dm.csv  dupes.csv  itp.svg
```

Again, your output should look different from mine,
but (assuming you store anything on your Desktop),
you should see a list of files and directories.
If your `Desktop` is pristine, congratulations!
You won't see any output.

The filesystem is organized hierarchically -
At the very top of the hierarchy is the **[^2]**,
which you can think of as a folder that contains all other files and folders.
On a Mac (and other Unix systems),
the root is referred to with a single forward slash (`/`),
While on Windows machines, the root is probably `C:\`.

!!! compat "Windows Users"
    When you open Windows Subsystem for Linux, you're actually running
    a fully functional OS with its own file system.
    As a result, when you type `pwd` in the terminal,
    you will see something like `/home/yourname`,
    rather than seeing your Windows OS home folder.

    But WSL has access to your files in a special path, `/mnt/c/`.
    If you want to see the files in your Windows `Desktop/` directory for example,
    look in `/mnt/c/Users/yourname/Desktop`.

#### Moving around

Say you are sitting in your room,
and you want to give someone directions to [Lulu](https://w100.wellesley.edu/lulu).
One way to do this would be to give directions from where you are:

1. Go out the door,
2. Go down the hall to the elevator
3. ... etc

In this case,
you're providing a "relative path"[^6] -
the directions only make sense if the person is starting in your room.
If they're at the Science Center and they follow your instructions,
they will become hopelessly lost.

Alternatively,
you could provide directions from a shared point of reference.

1. Start at the campus gate on the corner of Weston Rd and Central St
2. Walk down the path and turn right just past the Child Study Center
   towards the Botanical Gardens
3. ... etc

In this case,
you're providing an "absolute path"[^7] -
no matter where the person is at the time,
the directions will make sense.

An absolute path is great,
since the same instructions are useful in most situations,
but in many cases, it would be tedious to always have to start instructions
from the same location.

When providing a file path to a unix operating system,
you can also provide relative or absolute paths.
There are two shared points of reference,
your home folder and `root`,
which are specified by `~/` and `/` respectively
when placed at the beginning of the path.

Up above, when we looked at the contents of the Desktop using ls,
we provided the _relative path_ from where we were in the home folder.
You can tell, because the path did not start with `~/` or `/`.

We could have done the same thing using an _absolute path_:

```sh
$ ls ~/Desktop
```
```
df.csv  dm.csv  dupes.csv  itp.svg
```

The output here should be the same as what you got above.
But what if we're in a different location?

#### [Change directory](@id cd)

In order to `c`hange the working `d`irectory,
we use the `cd` command,
giving a path as an argument.
For example, to make `Desktop` the current working directory:

```sh
$ cd ~/Desktop
```

!!! warning "Checking Question"
    Is `~/Desktop` a relative or absolute path?

It's a good idea (in general, but especially while learning)
to repeatedly check that
the thing you think happened actually happened.

```sh
$ pwd
```
```
/home/kevin/Desktop
```
```sh
$ ls
```
```
df.csv  dm.csv  dupes.csv  itp.svg
```

Notice that with `ls`,
we didn't have to give `Desktop` as an argument this time.
By default, `ls` lists files in the current working directory.

!!! warning "Checking Questions"
    1. What does `pwd` stand for?
    2. What does `ls` stand for?
    3. With `Desktop` as your working directory,
        how would you list the contents of your home folder?

Let's go back to the home folder.
Again, we can provide a relative or an absolute path -
the absolute path back to home is always `~/`,
but how do we do the relative path?
To walk into subdirectories,
we can just provide the name of the subdirectory,
but how do we walk "backwards",
into a parent directory?

In unix, parent directories are indicated with `../`.
So to go back home from `/home/kevin/Desktop` using a relative path,
I would write:

```sh
$ cd ../
$ pwd
```
```
/home/kevin
```
It is possible to be more specific about where you want to go after moving
up a directory. For example, I could write `../Documents` to go up a directory
and then move into my Documents folder.

You can also move up more than just one directory. For example, you can go up two directories with `../../`

#### Practice

Practice moving around your file system using `cd`,
and checking where you are using `pwd` and `ls`.
If you get lost,
just enter `cd ~/` to get yourself home.

!!! tip
    Rather than typing long paths (or even short ones),
    use the `<TAB>` key to do auto-completion.
    For example, with your home folder as your current working directory,
    type `ls De` (don't execute), then press `<TAB>`.
    This should cause the terminal to fill in `ls Desktop` automatically.

    Try typing `ls Do`, then `<TAB>`.
    The first time, nothing happens.
    Why? Because both `Documents` and `Downloads` are valid completions,
    and the terminal doesn't know which one you want.
    If you hit `<TAB>` again,
    it will display all of the options available.
    If you add a `c`, then hit `<TAB>`, it should complete `Documents`.

    As you're navigating around,
    try to do as little typing as possible.
    Get into the habit of typing a little bit of a path,
    then hitting `<TAB>` (twice if nothing shows up the first time).

### Manipulating files and directories

Of course, looking around is not the only thing you can do from the terminal.
Using the terminal allows you to rapidly
view, edit, and otherwise manipulate
stuff in your file system.

!!! danger
    It is possible to seriously and irreparably damage your computer
    using commands from the terminal.

    Be sure to follow instructions carefully,
    and be sure to keep your backups current.

First, let's create a directory for use in this course.
You can put it in your home directory,
or in `Documents`,
or if you have a directory where your course files usually go,
that's fine too.

I'll assume you're making this in `~/Documents/`,
but if you want it somewhere else,
just modify the path accordingly.
the command to `m`a`k`e a `dir`ectory is `mkdir <path>`.

!!! tip
    In many examples like this,
    I will refer to things wrapped in `<>`,
    like `<path>` or `<username>`.
    These are stand-ins for some other value.
    This is a signal that you should replace that text
    (including the `<` and `>` characters)
    with the appropriate value.

### [Create and explore directories and files](@id directories-and-files)

```sh
$ mkdir ~/Documents/bisc195
$ cd ~/Documents/bisc195
$ pwd
```
```
/home/kevin/Documents/bisc195
```

Now, copy and execute the following command -
don't worry about what it does.
(if you really want to know, you can read about it here: "while loop"[^9])

```sh
bisc195 $ for i in {1..10}; do echo "This is file #${i}" > "file${i}.txt"; done
```

It should finish very quickly.
Let's look at what it did

```sh
bisc195 $ ls
```
```
file1.txt  file2.txt  file4.txt  file6.txt  file8.txt
file10.txt file3.txt  file5.txt  file7.txt  file9.txt
```

The code you executed created 10 files,
each of which contains a bit of text.
Look at the contents of `file1.txt` using the `head` command.

```sh
bisc195 $ head file1.txt
```
```
This is file #1
```

The `head` command prints the first 10 lines of a file by default,
but this file only has 1 line, so that's all that's shown.

!!! note
    File names usually have 2 parts - the name and the "extension."
    The extension, like `.txt` or `.docx`,
    usually tells you something about what the file contains,
    or how it's encoded,
    but this is not a requirement.
    The files above could have been named `fileX.whatever`,
    and still have the same content.
    Usually, it's a good idea to have the extension reflect what's in the file,
    `.txt` for text, `.jl` for julia code etc.

We can look at multiple files at the same time using the con`cat`enate command:

```sh
bisc195 $ cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
```
This is file #1
This is file #2
This is file #3
```

`cat` takes any number of files (even just 1!)
and prints their entire content to the screen one after another.
Be careful - some files are really long,
and will go on and on and on and on and...

### Glob patterns

```@raw html
<p>If we want to print the content of all 9 files,
we could type them all out,
but that would get tedious.
There are many useful shortcuts in programming
(programmers <del>are lazy</del> like efficiency),
one of which is <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29>glob</a> patterns.</p>
```

The most common `glob` is `*`,
which stands for any number of characters,
including none.

For example,

```sh
bisc195 $ cat *.txt
```
```
This is file #1
This is file #10
This is file #2
This is file #3
This is file #4
This is file #5
This is file #6
This is file #7
This is file #8
This is file #9
```

Here, `*.txt` means "anything that ends with `.txt`".

Another `glob` is `?`, which matches any single character.

```sh
bisc195 $ cat file?.txt
```
```
This is file #1
This is file #2
This is file #3
This is file #4
This is file #5
This is file #6
This is file #7
This is file #8
This is file #9
```

Notice that in this example, `file10.txt` is not included,
since there are 2 characters between `file` and `.txt`.

Finally, you can use brackets to specify specific characters,
or ranges of characters:

```sh
bisc195 $ cat file[2468].txt
```
```
This is file #2
This is file #4
This is file #6
This is file #8
```

```sh
bisc195 $ cat file[6-8].txt
```
```
This is file #6
This is file #7
This is file #8
```

Let's make a new file that contains the content of all of the others.
The `>` character at the end of a command
redirects the output of that command into a new file,
so we can do:

```sh
bisc195 $ cat file*.txt > all_files.txt
bisc195 $ ls
```
```
all_files.txt file10.txt    file3.txt     file5.txt     file7.txt     file9.txt
file1.txt     file2.txt     file4.txt     file6.txt     file8.txt
```

Notice that the `cat` command in this case
didn't print anything to the screen.

We can check that the right content went into `all_files.txt`
using `cat` again.

```sh
bisc195 $ cat all_files.txt
```
```
This is file #1
This is file #10
This is file #2
This is file #3
This is file #4
This is file #5
This is file #6
This is file #7
This is file #8
This is file #9
```

### `m`o`v`e and `c`o`p`y files

We'll use this directory for the rest of this course,
but it could use some more organization.
First, let's make a directory called `lesson1`.

Can you remember how to make a new directory?
I'm not going to provide the command for this step,
but before moving on,
you should be able to execute the following command without getting an error:

```sh
bisc195 $ ls lesson1/
bisc195 $
```

When you first create the directory,
it will be empty,
so `ls` won't return anything.

If you see `ls: lesson1: No such file or directory`,
don't move on to the next step.

!!! danger
    Neither the `mv` nor `cp` command ask before overwriting files,
    and there's no "undo" at the command line.
    In other words, if you move or copy a file
    into a directory with file of the same name,
    the later file will be destroyed and will not be recoverable.

    Use caution when using these commands outside the context of these lessons.

Once you've created the `lesson1/` directory,
let's `m`o`v`e the text files we've created into it.
The `mv` command take the form `mv <source> <destination>`.
For example:

```sh
bisc195 $ mv file1.txt lesson1/file1.txt
bisc195 $
```

Now,

```sh
bisc195 $ ls lesson1
```
```
file1.txt
```

```sh
bisc195 $ ls
```
```
all_files.txt file2.txt     file4.txt     file6.txt     file8.txt     lesson1
file10.txt    file3.txt     file5.txt     file7.txt     file9.txt
```

As you can see, `file1.txt` has been moved to the `lesson1/` subdirectory,
and is no longer in the current directory.

If we don't want to change the name of the file,
we can actually just provide a directory as the destination,
rather than typing out the entire new path.

```sh
bisc195 $ mv file2.txt lesson1/
bisc195 $ ls lesson1
```
```
file1.txt file2.txt
```

In this way, we can move multiple files at the same time,
separated by spaces,
as long as the final argument is a directory:

```sh
bisc195 $ mv file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt lesson1/
bisc195 $ ls lesson1/
```
```
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt
```

Remember, `ls` without an argument shows us the contents
of the current directory.

```sh
bisc195 $ ls
```
```
all_files.txt file10.txt    file6.txt     file7.txt     file8.txt     file9.txt     lesson1
```

!!! practice
    Can you figure out how to move the rest of the `file*.txt` files
    to the `lesson1/` directory using a glob pattern?

Once you've moved all the text files _other than_ `all_files.txt`
into the `lesson1` folder,
change the working directory to `lesson1` using `cd`

!!! tip
    If you accidentally moved `all_files.txt` into `lesson1/`,
    you can move it back using the relative path `./`,
    which means "current directory."
    In other words, from the `bisc195` directory,
    you can execute `mv lesson1/all_files.txt ./`.

    Alternatively, if you've already done `cd lesson1`,
    you can do `mv all_files.txt ../`.
    Recall that `../` means "parent directory."

The `c`o`p`y command works the same way as `mv`,
except that the original stays where it is.

Check to make sure you're in the `lesson1` directory:

```sh
lesson1 $ pwd
```
```
/home/kevin/Documents/bisc195/lesson1
```
```sh
lesson1 $ ls ./
```
```
file1.txt  file2.txt  file4.txt  file6.txt  file8.txt
file10.txt file3.txt  file5.txt  file7.txt  file9.txt
```
```sh
lesson1 $ ls ../
```
```
all_files.txt lesson1
```

Let's copy `all_files.txt` into the current directory using `cp`:

```sh
lesson1 $ cp ../all_files.txt ./
lesson1 $ ls
```
```
all_files.txt file10.txt    file3.txt     file5.txt     file7.txt     file9.txt
file1.txt     file2.txt     file4.txt     file6.txt     file8.txt
```
```sh
$ ls ../
```
```
all_files.txt lesson1
```

As you can see,
`all_files.txt` is now present in both the parent `bisc195/` directory
_and_ the `lesson1/` directory.


!!! tip "Practice"
    Make a copy of `file1.txt` called `file1_second.txt`
    in the `lesson1/` directory.
    To check that you've succeeded,
    execute `ls file1*.txt`, and the output should be
    `file1.txt file10.txt file1_second.txt`

### Rename and `r`e`m`ove files

!!! danger
    Once again, there is NO undo when using the terminal.
    I once deleted 10 Gb of sequencing files from a lab server
    in 2 seconds with a 13 character command.

    Please use care with these commands.

We actually don't need 2 copies of the `all_files.txt`.
Let's `r`e`m`ove the one in the `bisc195` directory.

```sh
lesson1 $ rm ../all_files.txt
lesson1 $ ls ../
```
```
lesson1
```

Come to think of it - we don't need any of these files.
Let's remove them all.

!!! danger
    I know, I'm repeating myself.
    `rm` combined with glob patterns can do a lot of damage very quickly.
    Beware!

Before we do anything, verify we're still in the `lesson1` directory
using `pwd` and `ls`.

Then, remove all of the `.txt` files in the current directory:

```sh
lesson1 $ rm *.txt
lesson1 $ ls
lesson1 $
```

We don't need the `lesson1` directory either.
First, move to the parent directory (`bisc195/`) using `cd`.
`rm` doesn't work on directories:

```sh
bisc195 $ rm lesson1
```
```
rm: lesson1: is a directory
```

Instead, use the `r`e`m`ove `dir`ectory command:

```sh
bisc195 $ rmdir lesson1
bisc195 $ ls
bisc195 $
```

### Summary of Terminal commands

- `cd` changes the current working directory
- `pwd` prints (shows) the current working directory
- `ls <path>` lists the contents of a directory
    - `ls` without a path argument lists the contents of the current working directory
    - `ls <glob>` lists the files/directories matching a pattern (eg ls *.txt)
- use relative or absolute paths
    - aboslute paths start with `/` (root) or `~/` (home)
    - relative paths start with `./`, `../` or file and directory names
- `mkdir` for creating directories
- `mv <source(s)> <destination>` to move files and directories
- `cp <source(s)> <destination>` to copy files and directories
- glob patterns can be used to act on many files at once
    - `*` = 0 or more characters (eg. *.txt)
    - `?` = exactly 1 character (eg. file?.txt)
    - `[]` = specific characters or range of characters
        - eg `file[246].txt` = `file2.txt file3.txt file6.txt`
        - eg `file[5-7].txt` = `file5.txt file6.txt file7.txt`
- `rm` removes files
- `rmdir` removes (empty) directories

## Part 2 - git for version control

If you've ever worked on an assignment
and ended up with a list of files like

- `assignment1.docx`
- `assignment1_v2.docx`
- `assignment1_v2_kevins_comments.docx`
- `assignment1_v3_fix_final.docx`
- `assignment1_v3_fix_final_for_real_this_time.docx`

... you'll understand the importance of version control.

It goes well beyond naming of course.
How can you tell what changed between version 1 and version2?
Does version 3 take the comments Kevin made on v2 into account?
Is `...fix_final_for_real_this_time` _really_ the last version?

It's even worse if multiple people are working on the same document.
If you and your lab partner are editing a document at the same time,
How can you gracefully merge the changes?
What if the changes you make and the changes she makes are incompatible?

Software like Google Docs can address some of these issues,
but incompatible changes can still occur.
Imagine you're writing an essay about a dog.
At the beginning of the essay, you've written

> The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog

You and your partner are both refining this epic story at the same time,
and further on you write,

> Because of how lazy the dog was, she didn't chase the fox.

But your partner decided the first line needed some more detail
and changes it to

> The quick brown female fox jumped over the lazy male dog.

so your pronouns are out of step.

In writing, a mistake like this might just look silly,
but in programming, it can mean your code doesn't run
or generates the wrong answer.
Even more critically,
code often involves many files working together,
and keeping track of the versions of multiple files at the same time is necessary.

### `git` is a program for version control

`git` is a distributed version control system (DVCS).
That is, it helps one keep track of one's code,
and the information about versions is distributed among many systems.

!!! note
    Early version control systems were centralized -
    there was a single server that kept track of
    all of the information about a code repository.
    Users could "checkout" individual files to edit them,
    and the central repository would lock that file to prevent conflicting changes.
    This makes it easy to prevent conflicts,
    but is also a bit impractical.

    By contrast, git is distributed -
    each user's system contains the entire revision history,
    and conflicts between versions are explicitly managed when
    two different edits to the code are brought together.
    Don't worry if this isn't super clear at this stage -
    we'll get into some practical examples in a sec.

You can think of a `git` "repository" (usually shortened to "repo")
as a directory with super powers.
If you're looking at the directory using Finder or Explorer,
it might not look any different,
but it's much more powerful.
Before we get into that, though,
we need to get `git` installed.

### Installing git

If you are using Windows Subsystem for linux,
or a linux operation system, `git` should already be installed.

**Step 1:**

!!! practice "ToDo: Check if git is installed"
    Check if `git` is installed by executing `git --help` in the terminal.

    ```sh
    $ git --help
    ```
    ```
    usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
            [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
            [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
            [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
            <command> [<args>]

    These are common Git commands used in various situations:

    start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
    clone      Clone a repository into a new directory
    init       Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
    # ... output truncated
    ```

    If you're using a Mac, git might not be installed.
    Executing the command above will probably result in an error message:

    ```
    bash: git: command not found...
    ```

    So you need to install it
    (if the `git` help message appeared, you can skip [to here](@ref configuring_git)).

    The easiest way to install git on a mac is using [`homebrew`](http://brew.sh).

**Step 1b**: 

!!! practice "ToDo: Install git"
    If you're using a mac and don't have git installed,
    enter the following commands into your terminal (excluding the `$`),
    then press `enter` to execute.

    ```sh
    $ xcode-select --install
    ```

    This may prompt you to download and install "command line developer tools"
    from the app store.
    If it does, click install and follow the prompts.
    When that's finished, and you see the command prompt (`$`) again, run the following command.
    Note: this is a case when you should probably use copy/paste.

    ```
    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```
    ```
    ==> This script will install:
    /usr/local/bin/brew
    /usr/local/share/doc/homebrew
    /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1
    /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew
    /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/brew
    /usr/local/Homebrew
    ==> The following new directories will be created:
    /usr/local/sbin
    # ...
    ```

    And follow the prompts.
    If you are asked for your password,
    use the one you use to log into your computer.
    Note that you will not see anything appear as you type,
    just type the password and hit `enter`.

### [Configuring git](@id configuring_git)

The next step is to tell git your name and email address,
so that you are credited with the changes you make to repositories.

**Step 2:**

!!! practice "ToDo: Configure git"
    Enter the following commands,
    changing the name and e-mail address to yours.

    ```sh
    $ git config --global user.name "Kevin Bonham, PhD"
    $ git config --global user.email kbonham@wellesley.edu
    ```

### Practice: Create your first git repository

**Step 3:**

!!! practice "ToDo"
    In your terminal,
    change your working directory to your `Documents` folder (`~/Documents`)

!!! compat "Windows Users"
    You can perform the following steps either in
    the `Documents/` folder of your linux filesystem found at `~/Documents`,
    or of your Windows filesystem, which is found at `/mnt/c/Users/<your_username>/Documents`

**Step 4:** 

!!! practice "ToDo"
    Next, create a new directory called `my_repo`.

!!! tip "Reminders"
    - `cd` is the command for changing working directory
    - `mkdir` is the command for making a directory

    Look back at the previous section for more information,
    and don't worry if you need to keep looking up stuff like this.
    The stuff you do regularly will become second nature,
    and the other stuff is always a Google search away.

**Step 5:** 

!!! practice "ToDo: initiate the repo"

    Now, change your working directory into the newly created `my_repo/`
    and initialize a git repository using the command `git init`

    ```sh
    my_repo $ git init
    ```
    ```
    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/kevin/Documents/my_repo/.git/
    ```

!!! warning "Checking Questions"
    Is the path shown in the output a *relative* or *absolute* path?

    If you use the command `ls` to list the contents of the current directory,
    can you see the `.git/` directory that was created?
    Why or why not?

**Step 6:** 

!!! practice "ToDo"
    Open the folder in your operating system's file system navigator
    (Finder on a Mac, Explorer in Windows).

    !!! compat "Windows Users"
        If you created the repository in the linux filesystem,
        the easiest way to do this is to execute `explorer.exe ./`
        from the command line.
        [See here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-for-wsl-in-windows-10-version-1903/)
        for more information about how the Windows and Linux filesystems interact.

    This folder appears empty right now,
    but in fact, there's a hidden `.git` folder
    that will include all of the version information
    for all of the files that you track.

    Let's see how this works.

**Step 7:** 

!!! practice "ToDo"
    open the [`VS Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor and create a new file,
    then save it in your repository directory as `fox.txt`.

**Step 8:**

!!! practice "ToDo"
    In your terminal, list the contents of the directory
    to be sure the file was created.

    ```sh
    my_repo $ ls
    ```
    ```
    fox.txt
    ```

When you create new files, git does not track them automatically.
Let's see what git sees at the moment:

!!! practice "ToDo"
    ```sh
    $ git status
    ```
    ```
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        fox.txt

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    ```

So `git` sees the file exists,
but it tells you it's not being tracked.

**Step 9:**

!!! practice "ToDo"
    Let's fix that (the `status` message helpfully tells you how):

    ```sh
    my_repo $ git add fox.txt
    my_repo $ git status
    ```
    ```
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
    (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   fox.txt
    ```

The file is now "staged"[^10] -
that is ready to be "committed."
In git, a "commit"[^11] is used to register a specific version of a repository.
The current state of all of the tracked files in the repository
will be recorded.

We don't really need to track an empty file,
let's add some text to it.

**Step 10:** 

!!! practice "ToDo"
    In Atom, add the following line to `fox.txt` **and save**.

    ```
    The quick fox jumped.
    ```

    Now, back in the terminal, what's the status?

    ```sh
    $ git status
    ```
    ```
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
    (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   fox.txt

    Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   fox.txt
    ```

Notice that `fox.txt` now appears under both
"Changes to be committed" and
"Changes not staged for commit".

Why?
Because you initially staged an empty file,
and now there's a modified version of the file that has not been staged.
You can see the difference between the current state of the file
and what's staged using `git diff`

```sh
$ git diff fox.txt | cat
```
```
diff --git a/fox.txt b/fox.txt
index e69de29..395235f 100644
--- a/fox.txt
+++ b/fox.txt
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+The quick fox jumped.
```

The syntax of this output is perhaps a bit confusing,
but it's saying that a line was added to `fox.txt`.

**Step 11:** 

Let's go ahead and stage this change,
and then make our first commit.

!!! practice "ToDo"
    ```sh
    $ git add fox.txt
    $ git commit -m "my first commit"
    ```
    ```
    [master (root-commit) b183d56] my first commit
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    create mode 100644 fox.txt
    ```

    ```sh
    $ git status
    ```
    ```
    On branch master
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    ```

Congratulations! You have a git repository.

### Just keep committing

!!! practice
    Try making some more changes to this file,
    make some new files,
    and use `git add`,
    `git commit`, and
    `git status`
    to keep track of those changes.

!!! danger
    If you enter `git commit` without including a commit message
    with the `-m` flag,
    your terminal may transform into a text editor.
    If this happens,
    you may find it difficult to return to the command prompt.
    Try typing (don't copy/paste) `:q!` then `enter`.

    If this doesn't work, ask for assistance.
    If Kevin or the TAs are unavailable,
    you can always close and re-open your terminal.

    In either case, your commit will be aborted.

### Using git in this course

It might not be clear to you yet why
using a version control system is worthwhile.
If you don't trust me,
the fact that almost every software company uses git (or something similar)
should give you some confidence that it's important.

In any case, this entire course will use git and github.com
(a website for managing and collaborating on git repositories).
In the [first assignment](@ref assignment01),
you'll learn how to do this.

## Part 3 - Running julia code

For a lot of this course,
we will be using the julia programming language
rather than the command line.

There are a few different ways to run julia code,
and this section will get you acquaninted with a couple of them.

### The julia REPL

Open julia, which you [should have installed](@ref install_julia) in the first part of this lesson.

Your terminal application should open, running julia:

```
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.4.0 (2020-03-21)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |

julia>
```

Technically speaking,
this is the julia "Read, evaluate, print, loop", or "REPL".

When you enter text at the `julia>` prompt,
the REPL **read**s it,
**evaluate**s it as julia code,
**print**s[^12] the result,
and then **loop**s back to the prompt.

Let's try it! Type `println("Hello, World!")` at the prompt and hit enter.

```@repl
println("Hello, World!")
```

Don't worry if you don't understand all of the components of this command - 
we'll get there.

!!! tip
    As much as possible, try typing out the commands in these lessons,
    rather than copy-pasting.
    It's important to build the muscle memory,
    and to see the errors that appear when you have typos!

    For example, what did I miss here:

    ```@repl
    println(Hello, World!)
    ```

### Running julia from the command line

You can also execute short snippets of code from the command line.

!!! practice "To Do"
    Open your terminal and enter the following:

    ```sh
    $ julia -e 'println("Hello, World!")'
    ```
    ```
    Hello, World!
    ```

The `-e` is a command-line flag that tells julia to just execute the next command as julia code.
Note the use of single quotes (`'`) surrounding the command.

!!! warning "Checking Questions"
    1. What happens if you just enter `julia` at the command line without additional arguments?
    2. What happens if you use double quotes instead of single quotes? 
       Why do you think that is?

### Running julia scripts

Our code is often going to be much more complicated than what we've done so far.
In those cases, and in order to keep a record of what we're doing,
it's useful to put our julia code in a file.

!!! practice "To Do"
    1. Open up VS Code, and create a new file called `hello.jl`.
    2. Type `println("Hello, World!")` into the file and save it.
       Note the path to the directory where you saved the file!
    3. run:

        ```sh
        $ julia <path_to_directory>/hello.jl
        ```
        ```
        Hello, World!
        ```

When code is saved into a file that can be run from the commandline,
it's called a "script."
All of your assigments will be julia code written into files
and commited to code repositories using `git`.

But it's important to realize that all of this code is the same;
it's just text.
That text has specific requirements in order to be parsed
by the julia interpreter,
but whether you run code in the REPL,
from the command line,
or in a script,
it has the same behavior.

## Key Terms

[^1]: **filesystem** - a hierarchical organization of files and directories. 
      [Additional reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system)

[^2]: **root** - the top of the filesystem hierarchy. A folder that contains all other files and folders.

[^3]: **home** - a user's primary folder containing `Desktop`, `Documents`, and other user-specific folders and files.

[^4]: **command line** - a text-based interface for interacting with your computer. 
      Also referred to as "terminal" or "shell."

[^5]: **working directory** - the current beginning of relative paths. Equivalent to `.` or `./`

[^6]: **relative path** - a path originating at the current working directory

[^7]: **absolute path** - a path originating at the home folder (`~/`) or root `/`

[^8]: **argument** - a value passed to a function to operate on

[^10]: **stage** - Files with changes that are ready to be committed.

[^11]: **commit** - A unique reference to a specific state of a repository.

[^12]: **print** - In the days before monitors,
    results would literally be printed on a piece of paper.
    These days, "printing" just means displaying the results.

## More info on loops

Here's some more information about the loop you [ran earlier](@ref directories-and-files),
but at least for now,
it's not necessary to understand it.

[^9]: The code

      ```sh
      for counter in {1..10}; do echo "This is file #${counter}" > "file${counter}.txt"; done
      ```

      is an example of a "for loop",
      which we'll learn more about later.
      This executes code in a loop,
      usually with something changing each time.
      Here, the code `for counter in {1..10}` means
      "run this loop for each of the values from 1-10",
      and also provides a `counter` variable with that value.

      Inside the loop is a single command:
      `"This is file #${counter}" > "file${counter}.txt""` means
      "write the text 'this is file #1' in a file called `file1.txt`"
      when the value of `counter` is 1,
      "write the text 'this is file #2' in a file called `file2.txt`"
      when the value of `counter` is 2,
      etc.

      So, in the first cycle of the loop, `file1.txt` is created.
      We then go to the top of the loop, reset the counter,
      then we go again - `file2.txt` is created,
      the value of `counter` is set to 3,
      and so on.

      When `file10.txt` is created, the  loop is finished (`done`).
      All of this should take less than a second to execute.
