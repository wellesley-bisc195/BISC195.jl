## Description

Modern biology depends on computing.
At the same time, many biologists are intimidated by the prospect of programming.
In an era of high-throughput assays and datasets with thousands of samples containing millions of molecular sequences,
a basic knowledge of computational methods is critical.
Many tools for investigating vast quantities of molecular data have only command-line interfaces,
and analyzing these large datasets is impossible with excel or other software with a graphical user interface.
This course will provide an introduction to the essential computer science concepts
necessary for doing bioinformatics and biological data analysis,
including abstraction, control flow, functional programming, and modularization.
This knowledge will enable students to design, create and debug their own programs
to wrangle large datasets, use command-line tools with confidence,
and perform reproducible analyses.
In addition, students will learn practical coding-adjacent skills
such as interacting with their computer using the shell,
distributed version control systems,
and interaction with online biological sequence databases for DNA and protein
through application program interfaces (APIs).

### Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students will be able to:

- Navigate their computer and manipulate files using a command line interface.
- Determine the appropriate data structures for representing numerical or biological sequence data.
- Effectively apply abstraction, conditional logic, and control flow
  to write scripts to solve complex biological problems.
- Recognize the components of exceptions (error messages) and identify solutions to correct them.
- Use a version control system to keep track of changes to their code
  and collaborate with others on complex code bases.
- Find, download, and process large biological sequence datasets from an online source  
  using a public-facing application programming interface (API).

### Prerequisites

This course is an introduction to programming,
but examples will be rooted in molecular and evolutionary biology problems.
Students without prior coursework in biology should be able to succeed with additional effort.

Recommended: Molecular and/or Cell Biology.
