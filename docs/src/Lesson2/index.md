## Learning Objectives

**Concepts** - After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Distinguish between variables and function arguments
- Identify functions that operate on or modify data
- Compare and contrast common scalar and container data types
- Recognize errors resulting from using functions on datatypes
  that do not have appropriate methods

**Skills** - After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Use a plain text editor (VS Code) to modify source code
- Execute functions on different types of arguments in the `julia` REPL
- Use print statements and type introspection methods to
  investigate a data type
- Assign, modify, and copy variables
- Use github and github CI to check answers to homework

**Assignments** - This lesson is complete when students have:

- Read [Chapter 2](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap02)
  and [Chapter 3](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap03)
  of Think Julia.
- Cloned the Assignment 2 repository with github classroom.
- Completed assignment 2 with all tests passing.
- Run all code examples from Lesson 2 on their own computers
